## How do I play a new game?
---
###### First create a new account by either an e-mail account or logging in/authenticating through Google.

###### Start a new game instance

###### The two standard methods to play is either to use the Space Bar on the player's keyboard or to use a microphone. Humming or creating different pitches will change the frequency input which will move the player's avatar along the x-axis

###### Move inbetween the openings created by the Obstacles to score points. Each successfully navigated Obstacle will result in one point to the player's score. The highest scores will be recorded for each user and to the leaderboard.

###### Get creative with the ways to manipulate the player's avatar! Player's can use alternate forms of input such as a tone generated from a online tone generator or a musical instrument that has direct input into the user's system.
